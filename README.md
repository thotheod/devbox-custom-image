# Dev Box Custom Image with Azure Image Builder
This repo contains simple Bicep to create a Dev Box Definition with custom Image. It is not creating all the required recourses for a Dev Box, but it is focusing on the customization with Azure Image Builder. 

## Useful links

##  How-To / Summary
- Follow the steps in the [Quickstart: Configure Microsoft Dev Box](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service) until you reach the point of creating a custom image. So the prerequisite steps / resources required (and not covered by this Bicep) are:
    - Create a [Dev Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service#create-a-dev-center)
        - Create a [Project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service#create-a-project)
- Before yoy proceed with the next steps, you need to create a custom image. The documentation is not 100% correct. After I managed to create a custom image, I found out that the image was not validating because the OS SKU is not supported. The 1st and 3rd step below are generated by my Bicep, the 2nd step is done manually in the Azure Portal. (TODO - check if this can also be automated)
    -  Follow the steps in the [Create a custom image](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/how-to-customize-devbox-azure-image-builder). (NOTE: This is having a lot of issues - Powershell, not correct OS SKUs, no correct ARM templates - needs to be fixed)
    - Create a [Gallery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/how-to-customize-devbox-azure-image-builder#create-a-gallery) (or use an existing one) and [configure it / attach it to the Dev Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/how-to-configure-azure-compute-gallery#attach-a-gallery-to-a-dev-center)
    - Create a [Dev Box Definition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service#create-a-dev-box-definition)
- Create a [Dev Box Pool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service#create-a-dev-box-pool)
    - Provide [access to a dev box project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service#provide-access-to-a-dev-box-project)
- [Create a Dev Box](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-create-dev-box?tabs=no-existing-dev-boxes#create-a-dev-box)


## Note regarding Image Builder Managed Identity
The Azure Image Builder needs a Managed Identity to be able to create the image. So you need to add a new (or existing) Managed Identity in the imageTemplate (Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates) that needs to have a custom role definition assigned. as described below. The Role Assignment can be done on the whole RG hosting the image Library

```json
{
    "Name": "Azure Image Builder <Image-Name>",
    "IsCustom": true,
    "Description": "Image Builder access to create resources for the image build, you should delete or split out as appropriate",
    "Actions": [
        "Microsoft.Compute/galleries/read",
        "Microsoft.Compute/galleries/images/read",
        "Microsoft.Compute/galleries/images/versions/read",
        "Microsoft.Compute/galleries/images/versions/write",

        "Microsoft.Compute/images/write",
        "Microsoft.Compute/images/read",
        "Microsoft.Compute/images/delete"
    ],
    "NotActions": [
  
    ],
    "AssignableScopes": [
      "/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<rgName>"
    ]
  }





```
